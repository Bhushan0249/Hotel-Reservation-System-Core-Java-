This is my first project in Java,

built to demonstrate basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Core Java and JDBC. 
The project is a simple console-based application for managing hotel reservations,
with user interaction handled via System.out.println and Scanner for input.

Features

Add Reservation:
Book a room by adding a new reservation via console input.

Update Reservation:
Modify existing reservation details through console commands.

Delete Reservation:
Cancel a reservation by removing it from the database.

Get Reservation by ID:
Retrieve specific reservation details using a unique reservation ID.

Get All Reservations:
View all reservations printed to the console.
